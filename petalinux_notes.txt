========================================
Changes made for SDSoC/reVISION support
========================================

The steps found in the Linux Boot Files section of UG1146 (page 47) were followed to make the 
Linux system suitable for an SDSoC platform. In addition to these changes, the following changes were
also made:

1) Imported HDF found in hw_handoff using petalinux-config

2) Instead of modifying the bootargs in the petalinux-config menu, the system-user.dtsi file was modified to include "quiet".

3) Based on references in the ZCU102 revision platform, Instead of the xlnk device tree node cited in ug1146, the following was
   used (which puts the node in amba):

&amba {
	xlnk {
		compatible = "xlnx,xlnk-1.0";
	};
};

4) Changed the CMA size to 256 MB using petalinux-config -c kernel 

5) Used petalinux-config -c rootfs to disable packagegroup-buildessential to decrease size and align with default Xilinx SDSoC platforms.
   Also, it seems like being able to self-host is not as important with SDSoC, which is a cross-compilation environment.
